#Simple Javascript Calculator
* At this time, the calculator does not perform mathematical equations.
This project is a simple web app calculator that calculates mathematical functions based on user input and will eventually be able to consider the order of operations.
Just having completed a course on modular Javascript, I thought it would be interesting to implement what I learned while building this calculator. 


##Things to Complete

	
JavaScript
- Add ability to calculate
- Add Regex ability to filter order of operations
- Add parenthesis filter to override order of operations
- Add ability to input negative number 
- Refactor code and compile repetitive functions 
CSS
- Add UI and design features
- Make large screen layout

HTML
- Add divs for parentheses
