Simple Javascript Calculator

This project is a simple web app calculator that calculates mathematical functions based on user input and considers the order of operations using a reverse polish notation parser.
Just having completed a course on modular Javascript, I thought it would be interesting to implement what I learned while building this calculator. 

The user can also user the number pad and keyboard to input numbers into this calculator.
