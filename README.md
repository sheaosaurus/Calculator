Simple Javascript Calculator
* At this time, the calculator does not perform mathematical equations.


This project is a simple web app calculator that calculates mathematical functions based on user input and considers the order of operations.
Just having completed a course on modular Javascript, I thought it would be interesting to implement what I learned while building this calculator.
